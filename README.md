# NNTP_Hunter

Used for scanning nntp servers and determining if they accept non-registered users
or to determine if other servers in the blocks of known nntp servers will accept known users

Build according to RFC(4642,3977,2980,4643) the bits that explain the authentication mechanism.
Thread based default 15 threads.
I made this because python modules offering NNTP support are not really "Light Weight" for the purpose I had in mind in my opinion.

Have fun and be safe.

all comments are welcome.
